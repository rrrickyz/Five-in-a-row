# Week 2

## What have you done this week?

This week I have been reading some similar codes about how to implement a chess game. I think the hardest part for me is to render the UI. I didn't code in JavaFX before, so I have been learning the documentation.

## How has the project progressed?

This week, I have written the small framework of the UI, as well as the winning method for the checking. I am reading documents about the testing, but I still have no idea how to test it with JavaFX. Maybe it will become clearer once I get my UI done.

## What did you learn this week?

JavaFX, testing.

## What has been unclear or problematic?

specifically about how to render the chessboard and chesspiece, as well as how to test them.

## What next?

I will focus first on the development of the UI.
