# WEEK 3


## What have you done this week?

I have been working on the development of UI. I have to admit that the workload exceeds what I had expected, so I would devote more time next week on the development. So far the basic UI has been developed.

I spent a lot of time reading the similar codes, and I didn't quite understand their logics. I was not very sure about how the chess board should be implemented, and how exactly did the AI move the steps.

## How has the project progressed?

The progress bar is at 30%. The rest remains difficult parts.

## What did you learn this week?

Some javafx libraries.

## What has been unclear or problematic?

I am not sure how do I paint the chess grid and how to put chess piece on it?
A very small problem that I also encountered is that I wanted to add border to the imageView, but the imageView did not use the style method. I tried to add an HBox to contain it, but the CSS style didn't fit the imageView (there was some space left). I was Googling some and still haven't resolved this.

## What next?

I need to complete the Board part (drawing the grid and implement the Alpha-Beta pruning).
