# WEEK 4


## What have you done this week?

I was developing the AI's logic. The AI part has been next to the completion, but I haven't settled down for the value of evaluate function. Also, I was thinking if there it would be a more optimal way for the alpha-beta function.

## How has the project progressed?

The progress bar is at 50%. The next steps are finishing the board graphics and the human-to-human mode.

## What did you learn this week?

alpha-beta pruning.

## What has been unclear or problematic?

It was a bit hard time at grasping the concept of alpha-beta pruning. Also,
I saw some codes (they are not implemented in Alpha-beta), and I was confused that they used hashmap to store very large values like 10000 or so.
I am not sure why do they set a large value?

## What next?

I need to dray the Board graphics.
