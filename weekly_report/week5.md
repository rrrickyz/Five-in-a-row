# WEEK 5


## What have you done this week?

I have roughly finished the AI class, but some moves still need to be double checked and refined. I was still not so sure how to define the values for moves. Perhaps I need to consult some Five-in-a-row books. I have finished the framework of Board class, but because it was connected to the other classes, and the other classes were still under development, so I will leave it to the next week to finish it.

## How has the project progressed?

The progress bar is at 70%.

## What did you learn this week?

Alpha-beta pruning, Circle in javafx.

## What has been unclear or problematic?

Nothing so far.

## What next?

Board class and UI class.
